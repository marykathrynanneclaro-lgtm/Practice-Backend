Complete Backend Course | Build and Deploy Your First Production-Ready API
    by JavaScript Mastery


Front end
    > The user
    > Client - Device or App
    > Interface - what people interact with

Backend
    > Server - store, process, and send data

Device sends request to server
Server processes data
Server sends data back

Client and servers talk to each other using PROTOCOLS (hhtps is a protocol)

Finding a server needs the DNS (human readable) or IP (for computers)

IPv4 & IPv6

APIs
App talk to backend? Use API (Application Programming Interface)
API sends your request to the backend and returns the backend's data

APIs have a specific structure -> CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    > Uses HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete)
    > Endpoints - URL that represents a specific resource/action (get/user/data, post/user, put/user, delete/user) *remember REST APIs sa college*
    > Headers - containes extra data like metadata, datatype, etc.
    > Request Body - details of data other thn request
    > Response Bodt - response of server that contains details of data
    > Status Codes - indicate what happened

^^^ This is what the request from the client looks like ^^^

Types of APIs
    1. RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) - Stateless, does not rely on previous requests (uses JSON)
    2. GraphQL APIs - (made by FB) Gives more flexibility (request EXACTLY the data)

BACKEND LANGUAGE
    > Javascript, Python, etc.
    > Use frameworks for easier implementation of server (expres, django, etc.)

DATABASES
    > Stores data, easier if applications are scaled
    1. Relational Databases - (SQL, data like excel) HIGHLY STRUCTURED (inventory management, e-commerece)
    2. Non-relational databases - (NoSQL) Offers more flexibility, structured and unstructured data

How can backend interact with backend?

Client -> Backend -> Processes data and creates a query -> Backend sends queries to database

ORMs - (Object Relational Mappers) simplify database interactions, write queries using chosen language

BACKEND ARCHITECTURES
    1. Monolithic - all components are combined into one unified codebase, backend handles EVERYTHING
        - simple to develop, deploy, and debug BUT can be messy and have scalability issues
    2. Microservices - app is broken down into individual services, communicate with each other via API
        - great for large scale systems
    3. Serverless - write code and dont worry about underlying infrastructure (aws lamda)
        - perfect for startups, prototyping, spikey traffic
